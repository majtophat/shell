== Webian Kiosk Shell 0.1 ==

Webian Kiosk Shell is a graphical shell for the web, a full screen web browser for devices that don't need a desktop.

It's an implementation of a design concept called "A Graphical Shell for the Web" [1] by Ben Francis that has been edited by Cody Long to provide Kiosk caabilities. 

The code is designed to be run using Mozilla Chromeless [2] and currently lives on the Webian web site [3].

To run, check out Chromeless from github [4] and execute... 

  $ ./chromeless /path/to/shell/

...from the Chromeless source directory.
